Resource Utilization Maximization from Excel Data Analytics Tools                                  
(Excel Time Series Simulation)


Researched a local car repair shop that was not utilizing all their hydraulic lifts on top of a long waiting line/time for the cars to be taken in for service because the owners thought it would not be profitable to hire more staff to start using all of their hydraulic lifts. 
Technique – Dynamic Time-Series Forecasting and Simulation
Tools – Excel (Time-Series tool, vlookup, charts/graphs for EDA)
Responsibility – end-to-end implementation (data collection, data preprocessing, EDA, visualization, model building/evaluation/implementation, deployment as a presentation)
Achievement - separately include all aspects of the service process (front office, technician break times, service ticket updating, etc.) in a model and recommend optimizing profits by maximizing resource utilization.
